## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Ring identity matching (`dioptrin.identify_rings`).** Given a list of
  detected ellipses (sorted ascending by semi-major axis) and a known
  calibrant, identify which calibrant ring each ellipse corresponds to —
  with no input geometry hint (no distance, no beam-center estimate).
  Algorithm: the ratio `r_k / r_0 = tan(2θ_k) / tan(2θ_0)` is independent
  of detector distance, so a hypothesis-test loop over every
  `(anchor_ellipse, anchor_ring)` pair finds the assignment whose
  implied-distance scatter is tightest. Handles missing rings, spurious
  ellipses, smallest-ellipse-not-being-ring-0, and dense calibrants
  (LaB6 has 91 d-spacings) where the ratio chain alone is ambiguous —
  the distance-consistency check breaks the tie. Validated by 5 Rust
  unit tests on synthetic LaB6 (full sequence, missing rings, anchor
  offset, spurious extra ellipse, random sizes) and a real-data smoke
  test on LaB6_40keV_MarCCD.tif that recovers 10/11 ring identities
  matching Dioptas's iterative-fit labels (the one mismatch is a
  Dioptrin-rejected spurious ellipse).
- **RANSAC ellipse clustering (`dioptrin.ransac_ellipses`).** Given a list of
  2-D peak coordinates, fit a family of ellipses with outlier rejection.
  Implementation: direct linear conic fit (F=-1 normalization) with the
  ellipse discriminant check `4AC-B² > 0`, Sampson distance for inlier
  testing, greedy RANSAC that detects one ellipse, removes its inliers, and
  repeats. Optional `max_axis_ratio` filter rejects degenerate elongated
  fits when the user knows the detector is near-perpendicular (e.g.
  setting `1.2` for typical lab/synchrotron geometries). Returns sorted
  ellipses (semi-major ascending → ring order under a powder pattern) plus
  per-input-point assignment (`None` = outlier). Public Rust API in
  `dioptrin::calibration::{ellipse, ransac_ellipses}`. Synthetic Rust
  tests verify single-ellipse recovery to 10⁻⁶, multi-ellipse clustering
  with planted outliers, and pure-noise rejection. Real-data smoke test
  on Dioptas's LaB6 peaks confirms at least the brightest rings are
  cleanly captured at the true beam center.
- **Massif peak picking (`dioptrin.find_peaks_massif`).** A port of pyFAI's
  `Massif.find_peaks` algorithm: separable Gaussian background filter,
  binarisation against the local background, 4-connected component
  labeling, uphill walk to integer-pixel local max, and sub-pixel
  refinement via parabolic fit on the 3×3 neighbourhood. The Gaussian σ
  defaults to pyFAI's adaptive `max(5, max(dim1, dim2) / 50)`. Validated
  against Dioptas's pyFAI-backed Massif on the real LaB6_40keV_MarCCD
  frame: every Dioptas-picked control point has a Dioptrin-picked
  counterpart within sub-pixel distance (100% within 1 px on seed 1,
  96% within 1 px on seed 2). Combined with the refine-parity test this
  validates Dioptrin as a self-contained pyFAI replacement for
  calibration.
- **Geometry calibration (`dioptrin.calibration`).** A Levenberg–Marquardt
  refinement that takes picked control points and a known calibrant and
  refines the detector PONI. Highlights:
  - Hand-rolled L-M with finite-difference Jacobian (no `nalgebra` /
    `argmin` dependency).
  - Optional Huber IRLS loss for robustness against spotty / single-crystal
    contamination on rings.
  - Auto ring-assignment by predicted-2θ-nearest-d-spacing each iteration.
  - Free / fixed parameter mask (`distance`, `poni1`, `poni2`, `rot1`,
    `rot2`, `rot3`, `wavelength`).
  - Off-detector primary beam works correctly (PONI may lie outside the
    detector window).
  - Rotations wrap to `(-π, π]` after each accepted step to prevent drift
    along under-constrained periodic directions.
  - pyFAI/Dioptas pixel-center convention (`(d + 0.5) * pixel`) so picked
    points from those tools feed in directly.
- pyFAI-compatible `.D` calibrant parser; `LaB6_SRM660b.D` and `CeO2.D`
  shipped in `test_data/calibrants/`.
- Python API: `dioptrin.Calibrant`, `dioptrin.CalibrationPoints`,
  `dioptrin.CalibrationResult`, `dioptrin.refine(...)`.
- `LaB6_40keV_MarCCD.tif` + `.poni` test fixture from Dioptas's test corpus.
- `python_examples/test_calibration_lab6.py` — pyFAI-forward-model round-trip
  integration test (recovers a known LaB6 PONI to numerical precision).
- `python_examples/test_calibration_dioptas_parity.py` — cross-validates
  against Dioptas + pyFAI on the same 271 real Massif-picked points across
  10 LaB6 rings; refined PONIs agree at the picking-noise floor (distance
  to 0.4 ppm, PONI to 18 µm, rotations to 93 µrad).

## [0.5.2] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed

- Avoid an 80 MB `normalization` clone on every `integrate1d` / `integrate2d`
  call. `GeometryState.normalization` is now wrapped in `Arc<Vec<f64>>`, so
  the per-call cost is an atomic refcount bump. On a 12-worker batch1d run
  over Eiger 9M frames at 4400 bins, throughput goes from ~163 to ~303
  files/s, and serial→12-worker scaling improves from ~3× to ~4.8×. The
  single-worker numpy-array path more than doubles (53 → 127 files/s).

### Changed

- Batch worker loops (`process_files`, `process_files_streaming`,
  `process_queue_streaming`) reuse a single `Frame` per worker and decode
  TIFFs into its existing `data` buffer via the new
  `Frame::reload_from_tiff` instead of allocating a fresh `Frame` per file.
  Peak RSS during a 12-worker batch1d run drops from ~4.7 GB to ~3.85 GB.
  Throughput is unchanged.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed

- `python_examples/batch_benchmark_comparison.py` no longer hard-requires
  `psutil`; memory tracking is skipped with a notice when the package is
  not installed.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added

- `MultiIntegrator` for merging results from multiple detectors (similar in
  spirit to pyFAI's `MultiGeometry`). Sums raw signal / normalization /
  variance across detectors on a shared radial bin grid and divides once
  at the end. Available from Python as `dioptrin.MultiIntegrator`.
- `python_examples/batch_benchmark_comparison.py` for side-by-side
  throughput and peak-memory comparisons against pyFAI.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- `dioptrin.validate_license()` Python function for offline license-key
  validation outside of `Integrator` construction.

### Changed

- License format no longer carries a tier field; license keys signed in
  the new format are required.

### Fixed

- License exception classes are always registered on the Python module,
  even when the binary is built without the `licensed` feature, so user
  code can `except dioptrin.LicenseExpiredError:` unconditionally.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- `LicenseNotFoundError` and `LicenseExpiredError` Python exception
  subclasses for finer-grained handling of license errors.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed

- maturin wheel build for `linux/x86_64` (`-i` flag passed correctly).

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-02

Maintenance release: cargo fmt over license / keygen modules. No
user-visible changes.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- Offline license verification using ed25519 signatures for Python
  wheels. License keys are checked at `Integrator()` construction; the
  public key is embedded in the binary.
- `benchmark` optional dependency group in `pyproject.toml`.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `normalization` is now a required parameter in the LUT
  integration functions (`lut::integrate1d`, `lut::integrate2d`, etc.).
- LUT integration now follows pyFAI's weighted-average convention:
  `I = Σ(w · signal) / Σ(w · norm)`.
- Minimum Python version bumped to 3.11.

### Fixed

- `batch1d_iter` / `batch2d_iter` now preserve the input order of frames.
- README examples updated to match the current API.

### Security

- numpy upgraded to 2.4.2 (2.4.0 was yanked upstream).
- pillow upgraded to 12.1.1 (CVE-2026-25990).
